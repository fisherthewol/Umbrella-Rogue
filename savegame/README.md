# Savegame Folder.  
This folder is used by the game to save and load files using the shelve module. If the folder is deleted, then the game *should* create it, but if you're getting errors trying to save, that may be the issue.  

Similarly, if you are having issues starting a new game, try deleting the files contained. This should reset the save and allow the game to start.
